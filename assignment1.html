    <h1 style="background-color: black; color: white; text-align: center;font-size: 300%;">John Connor</h1>
    <h2 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: blue;">Main</h2>
    <p><span style="color: red">John Connor</span>, the son of <i style="color: purple;">Sarah Connor</i> and Kyle Reese, 
        is the leader of the worldwide human Resistance, as well as the more specialised Tech-Com during the War Against the Machines. Skynet,
        the supercomputer mainframe of the machines, decides that <span style="color: red">John Connor </span>is the focal point of the rebellion and his termination would end the opposition. After repeated
        failures at terminating <span style="color:red ;"> John</span>  during the war, Skynet decides to use a time displacement device to send Terminators
         to various points in the past in an attempt to terminate him before the war even begins.</p>
         
    <h2 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: blue;">Original timeline</h2>
    <p>
        On the brink of extinction, <span style="color: red">John Connor</span> united the despairing humans and taught them to fight, 
        storm the camps and overcome the Terminator guards.
         Much of the Resistance was created from these survivors.
         <br><br>
         <span style="color: red">John Connor</span> led the human Resistance to the victory in the War against the Machines in the year <u>2029</u>.
          In order to eliminate <span style="color: red">John Connor</span>, Skynet sent a <i style="color: green">T-800</i> and a <i style="color: green">T-1000</i> to the past to kill <span style="color: red">John's</span> mother
          , <i style="color: purple;">Sarah</i>, and young <span style="color: red">John Connor</span> respectively via Time Displacement Equipment. Thus, <span style="color: red">John</span> sends Kyle Reese,
           a young soldier, and a reprogrammed Series <i style="color: red">800</i> Terminator to the past to protect <i style="color: purple;">Sarah Connor</i> and young 
           <span style="color: red">John Connor</span> respectively.
    </p>
    <h2 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: blue;">Alternate timeline</h2>
    <p>
        <span style="color: red">John Connor</span> was born to <i style="color: purple;">Sarah Connor</i> on <u>February 28, 1985</u>. His father,
         Kyle Reese, had been killed nine months prior in <u>May 1984</u>, protecting
         <i style="color: purple;">Sarah</i> from a time-traveling Terminator. <span style="color: red">John's</span> early life was filled
           with training by various persons his mother <i style="color: purple;">Sarah</i> had met as the two
            lived off the grid after the attempt on her life by the Terminator.
             Much of his training concentrated on the areas of weaponry, computer technology, and espionage.

    <br><br>
    When <i style="color: purple;">Sarah Connor</i> was shot and captured after trying to blow up a computer factory in the early <u>1990s</u>,
    <span style="color: red">John</span> was placed into foster care and told that his mother's stories of the future were merely delusions.
      He was unable to cope with life in suburbia and rebelled, edging towards delinquency,
       turning into a young gangster and receiving a police record (which included 
       trespassing, shoplifting, disturbing the peace, and vandalism) by the time he was <u>10 years old</u>.
        His foster parents, Todd and Janelle Voight, found themselves unable to deal with him,
         and were not surprised when a police officer showed up at their door asking to speak with <span style="color: red">John</span>.
    </p>
    <h2 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: blue;">Deviating timelines</h2>
<p>
    Because <i style="color: purple;">Sarah</i>, <span style="color: red">John</span>, and the <i style="color: green">T-800</i> successfully destroyed the laboratory of Cyberdyne Systems,
     Skynet is never created and Judgment Day never occurs. In the year <u>2027</u>, <span style="color: red">John Connor</span> is a U.S.
      Senator and has a child.
